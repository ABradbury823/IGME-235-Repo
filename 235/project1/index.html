                    <i>Personal Eyes</i> is a 3D survival horror game made in Unity3D that I developed with a team of fellow students from June 2021 until 
                    May 2022. The gameplay primarily revolves around the premise of gaining access to a third person camera as a resource rather than a feature. 
                    My work on the project involved creating 3D environment models and textures, inspired by PS2-era graphics from titles like 
                    <i>Fatal Frame</i> and the earlier <i>Resident Evil</i> games. My workflow included collaborating with the creative lead, 
                    concept artist, and other 3D artists to make sure a cohesive artstyle was maintained. As a part of RIT's MAGIC Maker program, I 
                    worked full-time developing the game, attending weekly team stand-ups as well as triweekly stand-ups with 
                    Rockstar Games to gather feedback from industry professionals. We published a demo that includes our first level to 
                    <a href="https://violentvioiet.itch.io/personal-eyes">itch.io</a> in May 2022.

                    <i>Atoll Tale</i> is a 3D puzzle-platformer I worked on from August to December 2022 with a team of student developers.
                    The player controls Lula, a pirate who found herself shipwrecked on a series of islands in the middle of the ocean.
                    Equipped with nothing but a trusty shovel, the player must navigate the circular levels and dig up as much treasure 
                    as they can find in order to repair their ship. I acted as the team lead for this project as well as the team's artist, making
                    both 2D and 3D assets. As the team lead, I handled the Trello board for task management, scheduled team meetings, and 
                    made the final say on creative decisions. My artwork got me involved in character modeling for the player
                    and the enemy, environment assets, texture shaders, and UI elements. Inspired by whimisical Nintendo games such
                    as <i>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</i>, <i>Atoll Tale</i> has a highly-
                    stylized artstyle, providing several unique and fun challenges for a first-time project lead. A demo that includes the first
                    level has been uploaded to <a href="https://dinowolf10.itch.io/atoll-tale">itch.io</a>.

                    <i>Falling Hand</i> is a web application I developed with a partner from November to December 2022. The game 
                    is a simple falling sand simulator with a twist: by using the device's camera, the player can control where 
                    particles are dropped in the scene. The application uses the HTML Canvas element for drawing visuals,
                    ml5 PoseNet Machine Learning for tracking hand motions, and Bulma for styling. For this project, I was responsible for the 
                    falling sand portion of the game as well as the controls. I used ES6 classes to make a grid that draws and controls a
                    typed array of particles that can be one of three types: sand, water, and stone. Combined with the hotkeys on the mouse, 
                    the controls allow for a great deal of customization to the experience, even allowing the user to use their mouse if
                    they don't have a working camera. The website can be found <a href="https://people.rit.edu/amb7316/330/falling-hand/home.html">

                I am a Gameplay Programmer located in Rochester, New York. I currently attend the Rochester Institute of Technology,

                frequently practicing my Japanese reading, writing, and speaking ability. My two passions, game-making and Japanese,
                were formed back in my childhood when I played tons of video games and watched plenty of anime. I was always curious
                what went into making games and was fascinated by how the hardwork of a team of people culminated in the creation of my
                favorite games.
